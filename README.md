# < --- [ ArchNoN Project ] --- > #
[*] Two powerfull bash based scripts that automates a secure Tor+Firewall+No IPv6 configuration on linux distros(requires full root access).

# [ Requriments ] # 
[*] Required PKGs: 
- openbsd-netcat curl tor coreutils util-linux bash nftables sudo(some pkg names are different, depends entirely on your pkg manager/distro).

# [ Content ] #

- archnon >> Old version of the script(uses old/slower iptables, but works perfectly !!). 

- archnon-nft >> Modern version of the script, it uses the modern, clean, faster alternative to iptables: nftables. Sometimes is much faster than old iptables(better on all sense).

- example_bridges.txt >> It is just a list of tor bridges, you can grab them from here: https://bridges.torproject.org/options/en, or, if you prefer .onion: kgclfuro65jjlivyzfmxiq2kyv5lickrl4qd.onion/options/en

- try-dot-onion >> Try to curl .onion addresses(this script comes with some of them, for example: duckduckgo, hiddenwiki, etc) by running ./try-dot-onion, uses default's socks5 proxy address(127.0.0.1:9150), it might fail if you use a different address/tor is not running.

- make_it_work >> ./make_it_work, just moves the shell, scripts to your /usr/bin dir(run as root).

# [ Recommended Actions ] #

- Configure a Web Browser(prefer tor's one, it is very easy): You would have to force its internet connection to the socks5 proxy address/ports, ex(if torbrowser): Proxy address: 127.0.0.1, Allowed ports: 443,80,9150,9151,6969, then Restart it. Note: it doesnt makes you 100% invisible, as i said before, will depend entirely on your browser/config you have on it.

- Prefer a bridged connection: just in case you want to hide it from your ISP, or, even if Tor is not allowed in your country !!.
